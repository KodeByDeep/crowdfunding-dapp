# Crowdfund dApp

A decentralised crowdfunding application built on Ethereum as part of the CN6035 (Mobile and Distributed Systems) module coursework. This project is an adapted and extended version of an open-source crowdfunding DApp, with significant improvements to the smart contract, UI, transaction handling, and creator management features.

> **CN6035 Coursework Submission**
> Original open-source base was used as a starting point. All UI/UX improvements, transaction feedback system, contribution modal, withdraw/refund flows, reward tiers, cancel campaign feature, dashboard, responsive design, and documentation were built as part of this submission.

## Overview

Crowdfund dApp is a full-stack Web3 application that demonstrates how smart contracts can replace traditional crowdfunding intermediaries by enforcing campaign rules on-chain without a central authority.

- Campaign creators set a funding goal, start time, and deadline
- Contributors pledge ETH during the active campaign period
- If the goal is met, the creator can withdraw the funds
- If the goal is not met, contributors can claim a full refund
- Reward tiers can be added by the creator before the campaign starts
- Creators can cancel a campaign before it starts if no contributions exist

The application was developed and tested locally using the **Hardhat** development blockchain. The frontend connects to the smart contract via **MetaMask** and **ethers.js**.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- npm
- MetaMask browser extension installed
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KodeByDeep/crowdfunding-dapp.git
cd cn6035-crowdfunding-dapp
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Root dependencies (Hardhat, contract tools)
npm install

# Frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3. Start the local blockchain

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

Keep this terminal open. It runs a local Ethereum node at `http://127.0.0.1:8545` and prints 20 test accounts with private keys.

### 4. Deploy the contract

Open a new terminal:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
```

The contract address is saved automatically to `frontend/src/constants/deployments.localhost.json`.

### 5. Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Wallet Connection

### Add Hardhat Localhost to MetaMask

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Network Name | Hardhat Localhost |
| RPC URL | `http://127.0.0.1:8545` |
| Chain ID | `31337` |
| Currency Symbol | ETH |

### Import a test account

Copy any private key from the `npx hardhat node` terminal output and import it into MetaMask. Each test account has 10,000 test ETH.

> **Important:** Every time you restart `npx hardhat node`, the blockchain resets. You must redeploy the contract and re-import accounts if needed.

## Assessment Relevance

This section maps the project work to the CN6035 marking criteria.

### Back-end Implementation (20 marks)
The smart contract (`contracts/Crowdfund.sol`) implements all core logic on-chain:
- `createCampaign()` — stores campaign data with goal, timeline, and metadata
- `pledge()` — accepts ETH contributions and tracks per-user amounts
- `withdraw()` — transfers funds to creator when goal is met after deadline
- `refund()` — returns ETH to contributor if goal was not met
- `addReward()` — creator adds reward tiers before campaign starts
- `cancelCampaign()` — creator cancels an upcoming campaign with no contributions
- `getRewards()` / `getUserContribution()` — read functions for frontend queries

All business rules are enforced in Solidity with `require` statements, meaning no central server can override them.

### Blockchain Interaction (20 marks)
- The application connects to a local **Hardhat** blockchain (Chain ID 31337) for development and testing
- MetaMask is used for wallet connection, transaction signing, and network switching
- ethers.js handles all contract calls, event reading, and balance queries
- The frontend auto-detects the connected network and shows a warning if the wrong network is selected
- All transactions go through a 3-state feedback system (pending → confirming → success/error)

### Front-end Implementation (20 marks)
- Built with **Next.js 15**, **React 19**, and **TypeScript**
- Fully responsive layout using **Tailwind CSS** (works on mobile and desktop)
- Modular component architecture: WalletConnect, CampaignCard, modals, dashboard
- Real-time campaign status and countdown timers without page blinking
- Guest mode allows browsing without a wallet connection
- All blockchain errors are caught and shown as user-friendly messages

### Code Quality and Version Control (10 marks)
- TypeScript used throughout for type safety
- ESLint configured for code quality checks (`npm run lint`)
- Utility modules separate concerns: `txToast.ts`, `errorHandler.ts`, `web3.ts`
- Git version control with meaningful commit messages
- Public GitHub repository: [github.com/KodeByDeep/crowdfunding-dapp](https://github.com/KodeByDeep/crowdfunding-dapp)

## Scripts Reference

```bash
# Smart contract
npx hardhat compile                                        # Compile contract
npx hardhat test                                           # Run unit tests
npx hardhat node                                           # Start local blockchain
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost      # Deploy locally

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev      # Start dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Contract not available" error**
- Make sure `npx hardhat node` is running in a terminal
- Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost`
- Check that `frontend/src/constants/deployments.localhost.json` has a valid address
- Confirm MetaMask is on **Hardhat Localhost** (Chain ID 31337)

**MetaMask shows wrong network**
- Click the yellow **"Switch to Localhost"** banner in the app, or switch manually in MetaMask

**"RPC endpoint returned too many errors"**
- The Hardhat node has stopped — restart it with `npx hardhat node` and redeploy

**Transaction pending forever**
- Open MetaMask → Activity → Speed Up or Cancel the stuck transaction

**Insufficient funds**
- Import a Hardhat test account using a private key from the `npx hardhat node` output
- Each test account has 10,000 test ETH

**Rewards not showing in My Rewards**
- You must contribute to a campaign that has reward tiers set up
- Your contribution must meet or exceed the reward's minimum amount
- Rewards are only added before a campaign starts — create a new campaign with a start delay
